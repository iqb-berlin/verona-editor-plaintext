# IQB Verona Editor Plain Text
Verona interfaces are specifications concerning computer based assessment. You can learn more about this German initiative [here](https://github.com/verona-interfaces/introduction).

IQB\`s verona-editor-plaintext is a software component to edit any plain text for unit definitions inside verona compliant web applications. The main target for this editor are script based unit definitions or html oriented types.

## How to use

In order to use it, you need a verona compliant web application. The editor consists of one single html file. See the release section of this repository to get one. The filename makes it clear what version it is. After download, just go to the web application of your choice and upload it (there should be some admin function for this.

This editor does NOT send a type for unit definitions, because it doesn't know what the definition is for.

## How to contribute
